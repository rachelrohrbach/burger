## General Info
Devour the Burgers is a a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page to the Devoured Burgers List. The user has the option to change a devoured burger back to a burger that is ready to eat with the Make it Again! button. The app app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 
First the user must use the following command to install dependencies required:
```sh
npm install
```
The application is then invoked with the following commands:
```sh
node server.js
```
